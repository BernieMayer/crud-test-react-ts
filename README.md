# CRUD Test: ReactJS

Create a simple CRUD application with ReactJS & Material UI (MUI) that implements the models below and pages listed.

---

## üß© Application Pages

The application must contain the following pages with professional UI/UX design:

1. `/register` ‚Äì User registration
2. `/login` ‚Äì User authentication
3. `/dashboard` ‚Äì Overview of user actions/data
4. `/dashboard/profile` ‚Äì User information and profile editing
5. `/dashboard/books` ‚Äì User's book management (CRUD)

---

## üì¶ Models

### üßë User Entity

```ts
User {
    id: string
    firstName: string
    lastName: string
    emailAddress: string
    phone: string
    dateOfBirth: string
    role: 'admin' | 'user'
    createdAt: string
    updatedAt: string
}
```
````

### üìò Book Entity

```ts
Book {
    id: string
    title: string
    author: string
    isbn: string
    category: string
    publishedDate: string
    ownerId: string  // foreign key to User
    createdAt: string
    updatedAt: string
}
```

## ‚úÖ Required Features

- Use **Material UI** components. Refer to components [here](https://github.com/bluewave-labs/verifywise/tree/master/Clients/src/presentation/components)
- Implement **Clean Architecture**. Read this [guide](https://github.com/bluewave-labs/verifywise/blob/master/Clean_Architecture.md#clean-architecture)
- Ensure clean, descriptive Git commits throughout your work
- Store all data in **local browser storage**

---

## üõÇ Validations

- Validate all fields during user creation
- Use **Google's libphonenumber** to validate phone numbers
- User uniqueness: no duplicates based on `firstName`, `lastName`, `phone`, and `dateOfBirth`
- **Email** and **Phone** must be globally unique
- Book `isbn` must be unique

---

## üé® UI/UX Standards

- Build a modern, responsive, and intuitive UI
- Use Material UI components with consistent spacing and themes

### üñºÔ∏è UI Design Examples

The following files from the `/images` folder serve as design inspiration:

![Login Signup Example](/images/login-signup.gif)
![Sidebar Example](/images/sidebar%20example.jpg)
![Dashboard Example](/images/dashboard-example.jpg)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: These examples are **not** meant to be copied exactly.
> The more your design looks modern, functional, and polished like these examples, the more it shows your **experience and frontend development expertise**.

## üß† Developer Skill Level Indicators

> üí° **Important Notes**:
>
> 1. The more items you complete from the lists below, the higher your demonstrated skill level will be.
> 2. Please use AI tools as little as possible during this test. We will be reviewing your code using AI tools, and we want to assess your own knowledge and capabilities.
> 3. There are no right or wrong answers in this test. What matters is your approach, perspective, and the insights you bring as a developer.
